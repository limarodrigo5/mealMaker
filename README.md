# üçΩÔ∏è Meal Maker - Creating Today's Special

A restaurant has hired you to create a function for their website that allows them to set a meal and price each morning for Today‚Äôs Special. Use your knowledge of getters and setters to make sure anyone who uses the new function can generate a meal and a price for Today‚Äôs Special without any embarrassing errors!

## Learning Objectives

In this project, you will learn the following concepts:
- How to create objects in JavaScript.
- Using getters and setters to manage data.
- Validating input data to prevent errors.


## Features

- Set the meal of the day.
- Set the price of the meal.
- Retrieve the Today's Special.
- Input validation to prevent errors.


## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into a JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`).

3. Run the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   

To set the Today's Special, use the `menu.meal` and `menu.price` setters. For example:

```javascript
menu.meal = 'Lasagna';
menu.price = 7;
```	

To retrieve Today's Special, use the menu.todaysSpecial getter:
    
```javascript
    console.log(menu.todaysSpecial);
    // Output: Today's Special is Lasagna for $7.
```
